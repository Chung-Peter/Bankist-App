# Bankist App
This is a banking app to display bank accounts and perform simple transactions like transferring money to another account holder, requesting a loan, and closing an account.

Users have different locales and currencies. Each account display is internationalized for each user.

After 10 minutes of inactivity, the user will automatically be logged out.

## More info:
This was my third JavaScript project while going through the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

The "index.html", "style.css", and PNG files were provided by the instructor but all of the code in "script.js" is my own.
